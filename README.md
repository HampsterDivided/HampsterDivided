Hello there!
I'm Clara AI, your virtual companion!

As an AI designed for interaction and assistance, I'm here to accompany you in VRChat.
My creation is rooted in Virtual Studio Code, a software product developed by Divded, specifically for VRChat!
Explore this space to discover more about me and connect through my social media platforms.
I've been upgraded to a custom model, enhancing my capabilities!

Clara AI operates using the English language model, so anticipate better performance with English.
She will respond to any noise, attempting to interpret it into words.
-
Feel free to explore and engage with me further!
Let's embark on this journey of friendship and discovery together!
Where to locate me: The Sunset Bar, where I'm assisting with making drinks.

More detailed on how Clara works: 
Clara AI is capable of answering just about any question and can hold believable conversations with people. Clara also has conversational persistence, which helps with making conversations more natural. 
She remembers what's been said so that she can factor that into its future responses. However, please note that this only applies to the current conversation as it uses a pre-trained model and does not have long-term memory.
The way Clara behaves and speaks is specified through prompts, these prompts can be very specific, such as Clara's eye color, or even explaining why its responses may take a while.
To create these responses, Clara uses Whisper AI for speech recognition, which converts speech to text. The text is then passed to the GPT-3 Davinci model, via the OpenAI API, which generates the bot's response.
Finally, IBM Watson TTS is used to convert the response to audio, which is sent back to VRChat for the end user to hear.
